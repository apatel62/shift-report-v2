## Description

The goal was to create a shift report website. It is where the production leads can summarize how their shift went. After logging in, they select their shift, the machine, if its running or not, the parts made, and any comments they want to share. When they submit the form, it emails to the company a summary of that shift. If anyone needs to view the production history, there's a section on the site for them to do so. They have the ability to filter by dates, machines, and how to view the data (daily, weekly, or montly). The filtered table will be shown on the screen and there will be a link for users to download the table into a pdf.

The inspiration came from Arjunâ€™s work. Currently, the production leads have to manually write the email about how their shift went. This makes it difficult for supervisors or others to view production history as they need to grab the values from all the emails sent.
Therefore, website will be used to streamline and automate the process of filling out and storing the shift production data.

## Installation

No installation required. Users need a computer and a connection to the internet.

To run the code locally, you will have a .env file inside the server folder. The variables needed are: DB_NAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_USER, DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE_ID, JWT_SECRET_KEY, PDF_API_KEY, and SENDGRID_API_KEY. The DB variables are your local Postgres credentials. JWT_SECRET_KEY can be assigned any string. DOCUMENT_TEMPLATE_ID and PDF_API_KEY are the credentials from pdf Monkey which is the API we used to generate a pdf in the history section. SENDGRID_API_KEY is the sendGrid API that we used to send an email that summarizes the recent report created.

## Usage
